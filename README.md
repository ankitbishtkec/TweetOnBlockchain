Given media and publishing houses are owned by few people. And with change in governments and dominant ideology in society at the given time either records of opposite views are removed( in the past many libraries have been burned by invaders) or it is difficult to procure such records as due to those view's less popularity such books or records gradually go extinct as selling them does not make much economic sense.

Also, as a single person I can not do much to save my views such that it is registered for future generations. In older civilizations only things which have survived the time are few manuscripts, buildings or writings on stones(Rosetta stone).

The idea is to own our collective history, thoughts and views ourselves as a collective body and not depending on few book writers and media houses.
We found Blockchain tech to be a perfect fit for this. As, it is immutable, decentralized record keeper. It gives power to every single person to contribute to storing our collective info just by adding a miner node to the network. Also, every single person's thought is as important as any one else's as views are picked up randomly. So, this is really good model to give all thought equal representation as it is alleged that history is written by rulers/victorious.

# Steps to run:

https://github.com/ankitbishtkec/TweetOnBlockchain/blob/main/HowToRun.md

# Goals:
1- Helps to figure out the all views at given time in original proportion. We, do not claim of find the truth but finding the views.

2- Make it hard to change the views of past.

3- Adding ones view will need proof of work( i.e. substantial computing power) so that spamming is costly. Unlike Twitter where fake accounts and trend hijacking is a major issue.

4- Make it easier for everyone to contribute in saving views for future generations.

# Non-Goals:
1- Finding truth. Here, aim is to record the view of everyone without any discrimination. We however want to make sure that the recorded view's proportion is not skewed by spamming of Click farms.

# Reviewed items:
1- **Why public Blockchain technology for above goals :**

Public Blockchain makes sure that the views are stored in decentralised manner( so stored views cannot be deleted by attacking a city or region as the network is global; also anyone can easily contribute to saving the views by being a miner i.e. adding computing power to the blockchain network), the views are maintained using consensus( so views cannot be updated after storing) and uses open source software( so anyone can review it and validate its neutrality such that view for each person is given equal importance).

2- **How views spamming is stopped :**

Proof-of-work algorithm will be used to keep spamming in check. As, this will need comparatively expensive computing power. And we will validate proof-of-work before storing views on blockchain network. Fake accounts or Like farms will not be able to create much impact.

3- **How miners will be paid ? As, miners add computing power to blockchain network to maintain/ operate it.**

We feel that the appeal of the cause is strong enough to sustain the blockchain for community. They will not be paid, like contributors of Wikipedia are not paid.  

4- **Rather than hacking our views block chain, why someone will not make its own different block chain network ? like dictators can create new one :**

One can do so. But once a given blockchain catches on in public it is difficult to change it dominance. The first movers advantage will help too. Like Bitcoin has remained dominant crypto currency, despite lot of new crypto currencies have come and gone.
